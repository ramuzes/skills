Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

If the user passes a ticket reference, fetch the ticket from the configured tracker and state its title before starting. If the reference is ambiguous, ask.

Invoke the `test-driven-development` skill where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, invoke the `requesting-code-review` skill to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.
